We have developed a corporate HR management system that allows companies to track and plan their day-to-day employee aspects of their business. Our project utilizes technologies such as Azure DevOps, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and cloud database.

The project process provided us with an opportunity to integrate our programming knowledge in a comprehensive approach, enhancing our understanding of the field. We designed our application using an onion architecture structure. This enabled us to organize the layers of the application in a systematic manner, creating a more flexible and scalable framework.
